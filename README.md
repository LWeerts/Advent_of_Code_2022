# Advent_of_Code_2022
Just my collection of code for the Advent of Code 2022 challenges.

Instructions:
  Get the files local by downloading the zip or cloning the repository. 
  Run the python file for a certain excercise from the main directory.
  Input file location is hardcoded in the modules for now. 
  For some exercises, there is input_test.txt, which represents the example input from the corresponding exercise, which should generate the expected output of that example.
  This is a work-in-progress.
