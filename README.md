# Advent_of_Code_2022
Just my collection of code for the Advent of Code 2022 challenges.

### Instructions:
Get the files local by downloading the zip or cloning the repository. 
Run the python file for a certain excercise from the main directory.
Input file location is hardcoded in the modules for now. 
For some exercises, there is input_test.txt, which represents the example input from the corresponding exercise, which should generate the expected output of that example.

### Good to know:
This is a work-in-progress. Currently, I enjoyed challenges 12 and 15 the most and spent more time polishing these.
